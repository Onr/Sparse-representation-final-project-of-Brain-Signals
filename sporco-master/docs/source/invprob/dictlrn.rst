Dictionary Learning
===================

The :mod:`.dictlrn` module includes the :class:`.DictLearn` class that
supports dictionary learning via alternation between user-specified
sparse coding and dictionary update steps, each of which is based on
an ADMM algorithm. This is a very flexible framework that supports
constucting a wide variety of dictionary learning algorithms based on
the different sparse coding and dictionary update methods provided in
SPORCO; some examples are provided below.

The standard dictionary learning classes in :mod:`.admm.bpdndl`
and the convolutional dictionary learning classes in :mod:`.admm.cbpdndl`
are both derived from :class:`.DictLearn`. These two classes provide
less flexibility -- the sparse coding methods are fixed -- but are
somewhat simpler to use.

A :ref:`usage example <example_cdl_cbpdndl_jnt_clr>` is available.
